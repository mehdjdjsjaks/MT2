        <h1>Along with our core strength in technology and experiential learning, we have complementary strengths in the arts and design, making RIT a unique environment to study, build, and test Al. As we continue to build our excellence in Al and robotics, we must pursue our work with an understanding of ethical and socio-technical lenses. Given the interests of students, faculty, and staff, there is great potential to create living laboratories to responsibly experiment with technologies and gain rich insights into the ethics of Al. </h1>
